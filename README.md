Reddit Daily Programmer Challenges in Force Fortran.

Here I'll will be posting the challenges from Daily Programmer Reddit channel: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer written in Fortran. I use the IDE called Force from http://force.lepsch.com to write and test the programs.

I'll try to sticky the challenges with Fortran 77 and made them compatible with g95 and gfortran also.
